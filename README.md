# Learning Next.js üõ†Ô∏è  

Welcome to my **Next.js** practice repository! üöÄ  

This repository contains the code and examples I am working on while learning **Next.js**, a React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications.

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)  
- Static Site Generation (SSG)  
- Dynamic Routing  
- API Routes  
- Styling options in Next.js
