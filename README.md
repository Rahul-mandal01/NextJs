# Learning Next.js

Welcome to my **Next.js Practice Repository**! ðŸŽ‰  

This repository contains the code and examples I am working on as I learn and practice **Next.js**. It includes various experiments, practice exercises, and small implementations to understand the framework better.  

## Purpose
- To document my journey of learning Next.js.
- To practice and implement key concepts such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and more.
- To experiment with different features of Next.js in a hands-on way.
